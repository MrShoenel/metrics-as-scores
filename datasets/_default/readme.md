# Dataset Skeleton

This directory contains templates that are copied into the directories of newly created datasets.
The purpose is to give you something extendable to start with.
Some of the files, like `about.html` and `references.html` are even required.
There is also a document template for `Quarto` that you can render once you finished creating your dataset.
Once rendered, it generates the required `About.pdf` that you must include in your dataset, in case you intend to publicly share it.
