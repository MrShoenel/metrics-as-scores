Metric,Value,Description
"TLOC","Total Lines of Code","None -> user/context preference"
"NOP","Number of Packages","None"
"NOC","Number of Classes","None"
"NOI","Number of Interfaces","None"
"NOM","Number of Methods","None"
"NOF","Number of Attributes","None"
"NORM","Number of Overridden Methods","None"
"PAR","Number of Parameters","None"
"NSM","Number of Static Methods","None"
"NSF","Number of Static Attributes","None"
"WMC","Weighted Methods per Class","[0]; is a complexity measure; however, it depends on the definition of c, since it's \sum_{i=1}^{n} c_i, and c is deliberately left undefined; In the qualitas.class corpus, inf{c}=0, because we actually observed it"
"DIT","Depth of Inheritance Tree","None"
"NSC","Number of Children","None"
"LCOM","Lack of Cohesion in Methods","0; also complexity; Zero lack would be best; however, this is also a candidate for arbitrary user-defined ideal values -> maybe you are writing a class that is a collection of static methods, like C# extensions methods, so LCOM would be high."
"MLOC","Method Lines of Code","None"
"SIX","Specialization Index","0; because a high specialization is undesirable; SIX = (NORM * DIT) / ([No. of Added Methods] + [No. of Inherited methods] + NORM) -> we have observed 0"
"VG","McCabe Cyclomatic Complexity","1, lowest possible"
"NBD","Nested Block Depth","[0], or minimum possible; less nesting is considered better. In our case the average is returned and we observed values as low as ~0.3, so I guess 0 would be the theoretically lowest. However, also subject to user pref. I recommend NOT setting an ideal value since it is also a counting metric of some type."
"RMD","Normalized Distance","0; -> Distance from the main sequence (D): The perpendicular distance of a package from the idealized line A + I = 1. D is calculated as D = | A + I - 1 |. This metric is an indicator of the package's balance between abstractness and stability. A package squarely on the main sequence is optimally balanced with respect to its abstractness and stability. Ideal packages are either completely abstract and stable (I=0, A=1) or completely concrete and unstable (I=1, A=0). The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with D=0 indicating a package that is coincident with the main sequence and D=1 indicating a package that is as far from the main sequence as possible."
"CA","Afferent Coupling","0; but also user-preference"
"CE","Efferent Coupling","0; but also user-preference"
"RMI","Instability","0 -> Instability (I): The ratio of efferent coupling (Ce) to total coupling (Ce + Ca) such that I = Ce / (Ce + Ca). This metric is an indicator of the package's resilience to change. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with I=0 indicating a completely stable package and I=1 indicating a completely unstable package."
"RMA","Abstractness","None -> Abstractness (A): The ratio of the number of abstract classes (and interfaces) in the analyzed package to the total number of classes in the analyzed package. The range for this metric is 0 to 1, with A=0 indicating a completely concrete package and A=1 indicating a completely abstract package."
