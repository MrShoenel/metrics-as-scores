<h1 style="margin: 0;">Metrics as Scores</h1>
<p>This application accompanies the paper titled <i>"Contextual Operationalization of Metrics as Conventionality- and Quality Scores"</i>. Using the Qualitas.class corpus [1][2], metrics are transformed into scores, within different contexts.</p>
<p>This application allows to check metrics values of own applications against the contextual distributions as shown below. For conventionality scores such as TLOC, MLOC, NOM or NSC, this can indicate how common or extreme a metric's value is. For quality scores such as VG or RMI, it indicates an absolute quality, relative to the chosen context.</p>
