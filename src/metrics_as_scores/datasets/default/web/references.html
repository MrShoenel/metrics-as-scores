<!--
	This file can hold references that should be displayed in the web application.
	The references are appended to the existing list and will automatically receive
	numbers (mind the existing references that are always present). The format used
	in the existing references is Chicago.

	For each reference, just add a <li> element like so:

		<li>My first reference</li>
	
	Note this file must be present, even if you do not add any references to it.
