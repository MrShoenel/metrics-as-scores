<h1 style="margin: 0;">Metrics As Scores <small>by Sebastian HÃ¶nel, <a href="https://github.com/MrShoenel/metrics-as-scores" target="_blank">https://github.com/MrShoenel/metrics-as-scores</a></small></h1>
<p>This application accompanies the paper entitled <i>"Contextual Operationalization of Metrics As Scores: Is My Metric Value Good?"</i> Using the Qualitas.class corpus [1][2] and the "CK"-metrics [5] (among others), metrics are transformed into scores, within different contexts. It allows to check metrics values of own applications against the contextual distributions as shown below. In a greater sense, it can answer the question <b>"Is my metric value good or bad?"</b>, if either the type of metric has a built-in meaning of "good" or "bad" or if you choose one explicitly using a transformation type. For conventionality scores such as TLOC, MLOC, NOM or NSC, this can indicate how common or extreme a metric's value is. For quality scores such as VG or RMI, it indicates an absolute quality, relative to the chosen context. <b><a href="#help">Jump to Help</a></b></p>
