<p>
	This application was conceived to accompany the paper entitled <i>"Contextual Operationalization of Metrics As Scores: Is My Metric Value Good?"</i> [1].
	In that paper, the Qualitas.class corpus [2][3] was used to transform metrics into scores.
	This application, however, supports arbitrary datasets.
	Head over to the <a href="https://github.com/MrShoenel/metrics-as-scores" target="_blank">repository</a> to find out which datasets are available for download.
