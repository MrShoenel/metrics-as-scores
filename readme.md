Metrics as Scores
=================

Contains the data and scripts needed for the application __`Metrics as Scores`__.


# Setup (development)

This project was developed using and requires Python `3.10`.
To use a virtual environment, follow these steps (Windows specific; activation of the environment might differ).

```shell
virtualenv --python=C:/Python310/python.exe venv # Use specific Python version for virtual environment
venv/Scripts/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Here is a Linux example that assumes you have Python `3.10` installed (this may also require installing `python3.10-venv` and/or `python3.10-dev`):

```shell
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
